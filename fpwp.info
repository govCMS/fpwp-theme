; Drupal's .info files allow themers to easily specify some of the static
; properties of your theme. Properties such as its name, stylesheets,
; javascripts, and block regions.
;
; Drupal 7 stores a cache of the data in this .info files. If you modify any
; lines in this file, you MUST refresh Drupal 7's cache by simply visiting the
; Appearance page at admin/appearance.


; The name, description and screenshot used for this theme on the Appearance
; page at admin/appearance.

screenshot  = screenshot.png
name        = FPWP
description = Theme for the FPWP


; This theme is compatible with Drupal 7 core. And it is a sub-theme of Zen.

core        = 7.x
base theme  = zen


; This section controls the CSS files for your theme. There are 3 different
; things you can do with a "stylesheets" line:
; - Add a new stylesheet for your theme.
; - Override a module's stylesheet. If the stylesheet you are adding uses the
;   same filename as a stylesheet from a Drupal core or contrib module, your CSS
;   file will be used instead of the module's file.
; - Remove a module's stylesheet. If you specify the name of a Drupal core or
;   contrib module's stylesheets, Drupal will remove that stylesheet if you do
;   NOT include a file with that name with your theme.
;
; stylesheets[MEDIA][] = FILE
;
; The "FILE" is the name of the stylesheet to add/override/remove.
; The "MEDIA" in the first set of brackets is a media type or a media query.
; Typical CSS media types include "all", "screen", "print", and "handheld". A
; typical media query is "screen and (max-width: 320px)".

; First we remove the system's menu and message styling since Zen has its own.
stylesheets[all][] = system.menus.css
stylesheets[all][] = system.messages.css
stylesheets[all][] = system.theme.css

; Then we add our own stylesheet.
stylesheets[all][] = css/styles.css

; Various page elements output by the theme can be toggled on and off. The
